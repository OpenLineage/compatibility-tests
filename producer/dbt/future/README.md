# Future Enhancements for dbt Producer Compatibility Testing

This directory contains **design documents and prototypes** for enhanced compatibility testing capabilities.

## üöß Status: Design Phase / Incomplete Implementation

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important**: These are design documents and prototype code, not production-ready features.

**Purpose**: Document future enhancement possibilities relevant to OpenLineage TSC discussions about:
- Multi-specification version testing
- Compatibility matrix validation
- Forward/backward compatibility requirements

## Future Enhancement: Multi-Spec Testing

### What It Would Provide
- Test same implementation against multiple OpenLineage spec versions
- Forward/backward compatibility validation
- Spec-version-aware event files and reports

### Files
- `run_multi_spec_tests.sh` - Multi-spec test runner (prototype)
- `MULTI_SPEC_TESTING.md` - Design document and usage guide

**Estimated Implementation Effort:** 4-8 hours

## Future Enhancement: Multi-Implementation Testing  

### What It Would Provide
- Test different dbt-openlineage versions against different specs
- Virtual environment management per implementation
- Complete N√óM compatibility matrix

### Files
- `run_true_multi_spec_tests.sh` - Multi-implementation test runner (prototype)
- `MULTI_SPEC_ANALYSIS.md` - Analysis of implementation vs specification testing

**Estimated Implementation Effort:** 30-50 hours

## Current Production Feature

The current production-ready dbt producer compatibility test is in the parent directory:
- `../run_dbt_tests.sh` - Single-spec dbt compatibility test (OpenLineage 2-0-2)
- `../README.md` - Production documentation and specification coverage analysis

## TSC Discussion Value

These designs address key questions relevant to OpenLineage community discussions:

1. **Specification Versioning**: How should producers handle multiple spec versions?
2. **Compatibility Requirements**: What constitutes adequate backward/forward compatibility?
3. **Testing Standards**: Should the community require multi-spec validation?
4. **Implementation Guidance**: How should integrations handle spec version evolution?

The prototype code and analysis documents provide concrete examples for these architectural discussions.

1. **High Priority:** Multi-spec testing (same implementation, different specs)
2. **Lower Priority:** Multi-implementation testing (different versions, requires research)

These enhancements would extend the existing framework without breaking current functionality.
