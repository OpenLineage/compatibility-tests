# Multi-Spec Testing Implementation Analysis

## Problem Statement

Current multi-spec testing approaches in the compatibility testing space often implement **schema-level validation** rather than **true implementation compatibility testing**. This analysis examines the difference and proposes a comprehensive solution.

## Current Implementation Limitations

### Schema-Level Multi-Spec Testing
```bash
# Current approach: Same OpenLineage client library (1.37.0)
# Same dbt-openlineage integration  
# Same Python environment

# Only changes schema validation target:
./run_dbt_tests.sh --openlineage-release "2-0-2"  # Validates against 2-0-2 schema
./run_dbt_tests.sh --openlineage-release "2-0-1"  # Validates against 2-0-1 schema  
./run_dbt_tests.sh --openlineage-release "1-1-1"  # Validates against 1-1-1 schema
```

### Limitations:
- **Same library implementation** across all spec versions
- **Same validation logic** for all specifications
- **Same event generation code** 
- **Limited compatibility insights** between different library versions
- **No implementation evolution testing**

### Schema-Level Output Example:
```json
// All events use same producer, different schema validation targets
{
  "producer": "https://github.com/OpenLineage/OpenLineage/tree/1.37.0/integration/dbt",
  "schemaURL": "https://openlineage.io/spec/2-0-2/OpenLineage.json#/$defs/RunEvent"
}
{
  "producer": "https://github.com/OpenLineage/OpenLineage/tree/1.37.0/integration/dbt", 
  "schemaURL": "https://openlineage.io/spec/2-0-1/OpenLineage.json#/$defs/RunEvent"
}
```

## Proposed Implementation-Level Multi-Spec Testing 

### Implementation-Level Approach:
```bash
# Different virtual environments
# Different OpenLineage client versions
# Different dbt-openlineage integration versions

# Spec 2-0-2 → venv with openlineage-python==1.37.0
# Spec 2-0-1 → venv with openlineage-python==1.35.0  
# Spec 1-1-1 → venv with openlineage-python==1.30.0
```

### Implementation-Level Benefits:
- **Different library implementations** per specification version
- **Different validation logic** based on actual library capabilities
- **True backward/forward compatibility testing**
- **Isolated environments** prevent version conflicts
- **Comprehensive multi-implementation validation**

### Implementation-Level Output Example:
```json
// Events from different actual implementations
{
  "producer": "https://github.com/OpenLineage/OpenLineage/tree/1.37.0/integration/dbt",
  "schemaURL": "https://openlineage.io/spec/2-0-2/OpenLineage.json#/$defs/RunEvent"
}
{
  "producer": "https://github.com/OpenLineage/OpenLineage/tree/1.35.0/integration/dbt",
  "schemaURL": "https://openlineage.io/spec/2-0-1/OpenLineage.json#/$defs/RunEvent"  
}
```

## Implementation Challenges

### Version Mapping Research Requirements
```bash
# Research needed: Which OpenLineage client versions support which specifications
SPEC_TO_CLIENT_VERSION["2-0-2"]="1.37.0"  # Requires verification
SPEC_TO_CLIENT_VERSION["2-0-1"]="1.35.0"  # Requires verification  
SPEC_TO_CLIENT_VERSION["1-1-1"]="1.30.0"  # ← Need to verify
```

### 2. Virtual Environment Management
- Creating isolated Python environments per spec version
- Installing specific OpenLineage client versions
- Managing dependencies and conflicts

### 3. Compatibility Matrix Complexity
| OpenLineage Client | Spec 2-0-2 | Spec 2-0-1 | Spec 1-1-1 |
|-------------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|
| 1.37.0            | ✅ Native   | ✅ Compat   | ✅ Compat   |
| 1.35.0            | ❓ Unknown  | ✅ Native   | ✅ Compat   |
| 1.30.0            | ❓ Unknown  | ❓ Unknown  | ✅ Native   |

## Next Steps

### 1. Research Required
```bash
# Find out which OpenLineage Python client versions were released with which specs
# Check OpenLineage release history
# Verify dbt-openlineage compatibility matrix
```

### 2. Test The True Multi-Spec Runner
```bash
cd /path/to/compatibility-tests/producer/dbt

# Run true multi-spec testing (once we have version mappings)
./run_true_multi_spec_tests.sh \
  --openlineage-directory /path/to/openlineage \
  --spec-versions 2-0-2,2-0-1
```

### Cross-Implementation Analysis
```bash
# Compare events from different actual implementations
diff output/spec_2-0-2/openlineage_events_2-0-2.jsonl \
     output/spec_2-0-1/openlineage_events_2-0-1.jsonl

# Analyze real implementation differences beyond schema URLs
```

## Analysis Summary

Current compatibility testing approaches often implement **schema-level validation** rather than **implementation-level compatibility testing**. 

The proposed `run_true_multi_spec_tests.sh` framework addresses this gap by providing:

### Required Research & Development
1. **Version Mapping Research**: Determine correct OpenLineage client to specification version mappings
2. **Implementation Testing**: Validate with real version combinations  
3. **Compatibility Matrix Documentation**: Document actual compatibility results

### Expected Outcome
**Comprehensive implementation-level multi-spec compatibility testing** rather than schema-only validation, providing genuine insights into backward/forward compatibility behavior across OpenLineage library versions.
