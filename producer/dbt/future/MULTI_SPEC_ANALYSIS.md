# Multi-Spec Testing: Current vs True Implementation

## The Problem You Identified

You correctly identified that our current "multi-spec" testing is **superficial** - we're only changing schema URLs but using the same OpenLineage library implementation.

## Current Approach (Pseudo-Multi-Spec)

### What `run_multi_spec_tests.sh` Actually Does:
```bash
# Same OpenLineage client library (1.37.0)
# Same dbt-openlineage integration  
# Same Python environment

# Only changes:
./run_dbt_tests.sh --openlineage-release "2-0-2"  # Changes schema URL only
./run_dbt_tests.sh --openlineage-release "2-0-1"  # Changes schema URL only  
./run_dbt_tests.sh --openlineage-release "1-1-1"  # Changes schema URL only
```

### Problems:
- ❌ **Same library implementation** across all "spec versions"
- ❌ **Same validation logic** for all specs
- ❌ **Same event generation code** 
- ❌ **No real compatibility testing** between different library versions
- ❌ **Missing backward/forward compatibility validation**

### What We Get:
```json
// All events use same producer, just different schemaURL
{
  "producer": "https://github.com/OpenLineage/OpenLineage/tree/1.37.0/integration/dbt",
  "schemaURL": "https://openlineage.io/spec/2-0-2/OpenLineage.json#/$defs/RunEvent"
}
{
  "producer": "https://github.com/OpenLineage/OpenLineage/tree/1.37.0/integration/dbt", 
  "schemaURL": "https://openlineage.io/spec/2-0-1/OpenLineage.json#/$defs/RunEvent"
}
```

## True Multi-Spec Implementation 

### What `run_true_multi_spec_tests.sh` Does:
```bash
# Different virtual environments
# Different OpenLineage client versions
# Different dbt-openlineage integration versions

# Spec 2-0-2 → venv with openlineage-python==1.37.0
# Spec 2-0-1 → venv with openlineage-python==1.35.0  
# Spec 1-1-1 → venv with openlineage-python==1.30.0
```

### Benefits:
- ✅ **Different library implementations** per spec version
- ✅ **Different validation logic** based on actual library capabilities
- ✅ **Real backward/forward compatibility testing**
- ✅ **Isolated environments** prevent version conflicts
- ✅ **True multi-implementation testing**

### What We Get:
```json
// Events from different actual implementations
{
  "producer": "https://github.com/OpenLineage/OpenLineage/tree/1.37.0/integration/dbt",
  "schemaURL": "https://openlineage.io/spec/2-0-2/OpenLineage.json#/$defs/RunEvent"
}
{
  "producer": "https://github.com/OpenLineage/OpenLineage/tree/1.35.0/integration/dbt",
  "schemaURL": "https://openlineage.io/spec/2-0-1/OpenLineage.json#/$defs/RunEvent"  
}
```

## Implementation Challenges

### 1. Version Mapping Research Needed
```bash
# We need to research which OpenLineage client versions support which specs
SPEC_TO_CLIENT_VERSION["2-0-2"]="1.37.0"  # ← Need to verify
SPEC_TO_CLIENT_VERSION["2-0-1"]="1.35.0"  # ← Need to verify  
SPEC_TO_CLIENT_VERSION["1-1-1"]="1.30.0"  # ← Need to verify
```

### 2. Virtual Environment Management
- Creating isolated Python environments per spec version
- Installing specific OpenLineage client versions
- Managing dependencies and conflicts

### 3. Compatibility Matrix Complexity
| OpenLineage Client | Spec 2-0-2 | Spec 2-0-1 | Spec 1-1-1 |
|-------------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|
| 1.37.0            | ✅ Native   | ✅ Compat   | ✅ Compat   |
| 1.35.0            | ❓ Unknown  | ✅ Native   | ✅ Compat   |
| 1.30.0            | ❓ Unknown  | ❓ Unknown  | ✅ Native   |

## Next Steps

### 1. Research Required
```bash
# Find out which OpenLineage Python client versions were released with which specs
# Check OpenLineage release history
# Verify dbt-openlineage compatibility matrix
```

### 2. Test The True Multi-Spec Runner
```bash
cd /path/to/compatibility-tests/producer/dbt

# Run true multi-spec testing (once we have version mappings)
./run_true_multi_spec_tests.sh \
  --openlineage-directory /path/to/openlineage \
  --spec-versions 2-0-2,2-0-1
```

### 3. Compare Results
```bash
# Compare events from different actual implementations
diff output/spec_2-0-2/openlineage_events_2-0-2.jsonl \
     output/spec_2-0-1/openlineage_events_2-0-1.jsonl

# Look for real implementation differences, not just schema URLs
```

## Conclusion

You identified a critical gap! Our current approach is **configuration-level multi-spec testing** but what we really need is **implementation-level multi-spec testing**.

The new `run_true_multi_spec_tests.sh` provides the foundation, but we need to:
1. Research the correct version mappings
2. Test it with real version combinations  
3. Document the actual compatibility matrix

This will give us **real multi-spec compatibility testing** instead of just changing schema URLs.
